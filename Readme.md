# XoXoPay: Social Payments on Stellar ⚡

XoXoPay is a high-speed, interactive social payments platform built on the Stellar blockchain with Soroban smart contracts. It transforms standard financial transactions into peer-to-peer social interactions—allowing users to pay friends, add comments, toggle likes, and share payments publicly or privately, similar to Venmo and Cash App.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Social Payments Feed**: Share peer-to-peer payments (e.g. *"Ebube paid ₦5,000 to Tolu for Lunch"*) with interactive liking and commenting.
2. **Fiat Settlement via Stellar Anchors**: Seamlessly deposit and withdraw fiat currencies (including Naira ₦) with automated conversion and settlement handled directly through regulated Stellar Anchors (SEP-24 / SEP-38).
3. **Cross-Chain Bridge Funding**: Fund your Stellar wallet from other major blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon) using our Allbridge Core integration.
4. **Soroban Smart Contracts**: High-speed, secure, and gas-efficient execution of payments and social graphs on-chain.
